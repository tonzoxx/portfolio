<h2>Background</h2>

<p>There was a need within Digideck for users to select and save colors to be used within the Text Editor as well as the future built Design Center.</p>

<p>The original editor had only allowed for a single hex color, it was stored for the session of the page only. Our goal was to create a new library to store colors. Later the scope expanded to also add the ability to create gradients and use rgba.</p>

<p>Goals of the Tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>Library for Creating Colors for on Brand Customization</li>
<li>Upgrade and face lift existing color picker</li>
</ul>

<h3>New Workspace and Color Palette</h3>

<p>As a business tool a seperate page seemed most expected in terms of a library for all the colors. The palette will eventually be available via the picker tool as well so having this a seperate space will allow for simple color creation as well as advance colors for theme building.</p>

<p>This will also be the new standard for the other workspaces we plan to utilize for the future <a href="../design-center/">Design Center</a> we are building.</p>

<h3>Upgrading the Existing Color Picker</h3>

<p>We wanted to continue to use the existing color picker but add more features to it.</p>

<p>Feature set of :</p>

<ul>
<li>Solid Color</li>
<li>Linear Gradients</li>
<li>Radial Gradients</li>
<li>Add rgba</li>
<li>Include Custom Swatches from Palette</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding in New Functionality</h3>

<p>Adding in the ability to create gradients was a completely new piece of functionality outside of the ability of the color picker we were using. We found a tool for gradients we could use and expand the capabilities of our current picker as it was set to work with any existing color picker.</p>
